PowerPoint VBA Hotkey Issue: Hint Feature
Overview
This VBA project adds a dynamic Hint Feature for PowerPoint slideshows. Teachers can press the "H" key during the slideshow to toggle through hints (e.g., Hint 1, Hint 2). Hints are loaded dynamically from files linked to the current slide.

The Problem
When starting the slideshow, it gives a runtime error on the Private Sub PPTEvent_SlideShowNextClick line.
Event Handling Limitation: Using WithEvents and custom classes (ClsEventHandler) has proven inconsistent and error-prone.




A reliable way to detect and handle key presses (specifically "H") during the slideshow.
Solutions or alternatives that improve the functionality.


Code & File
The full VBA code and PowerPoint file are included in the repository.
Any advice or solutions.
